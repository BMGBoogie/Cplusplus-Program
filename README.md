# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project that I chose to include in my repository was one that I created in order to create a clock for the users of a specific site that reflects the current time and will allow the users to alter the clock by adding time of different increments.
  
What did you do particularly well?
  In this project, I think I did a good job focusing on the variables and also the functions that the user's input would alter in order to account for changes to the variabales.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  Within this project, I think that I probably could've focused on the declarations a little more and could've minimized the over all code character's with shortcuts I learned later as opposed to the initial commands (i.e. /n vs. << endl)
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  With this code in particular, I think that formatting was the biggest challenge for me. I had to utilize some resources I found online, as well as one of my colleagues for advice on the formatting of the clocks.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  I think that this project was the most impactful on my experience with creating variables, and making changes to those existing variables while continuing to maintain their declaration.
  
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I know that throughout the class I struggled with citations so that is definitely a learning experience, but I think that I wrote this code in a way that simplifies its readability and creates a foundation that can be integrated and altered with ease.
